JobBot is an job finding/working platform application.

# Background story

Australia boasts a substantial casual job market wherein individuals seek additional income during their off-duty hours or for various other purposes. However, for employers, the management of advertisements and control over the recruitment process can be financially burdensome. Similarly, for employees, the quest for suitable casual employment can be time-consuming, potentially resulting in delays in salary payments, unfair distribution of responsibilities, or even instances of fraud. Furthermore, the absence of formal contracts between employers and employees in casual positions contributes to the insecurity surrounding job roles for both parties.

Enter JobBot, a comprehensive solution that streamlines the entire recruitment process. This includes verifying users' eligibility to work, facilitating contract signing, salary disbursement, and allocating employees to suitable casual positions. From the perspective of employers, JobBot provides a platform for posting job advertisements, allowing prospective employees to exercise their autonomy in selecting suitable opportunities. Employers remit fees to JobBot, which in turn oversees the verification of outcomes between employers and employees, ensuring satisfaction on both ends and guaranteeing fair and legal treatment of employees.

In essence, JobBot assumes the role of recruitment manager, matching employees with appropriate tasks and acting as the intermediary in contract agreements. Employers, in this context, function primarily as purchasers, acquiring specific outcomes through JobBot's services.
